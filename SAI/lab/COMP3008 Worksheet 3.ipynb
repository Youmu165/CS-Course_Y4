A _formulation_ of a problem is a set of formulas that describe the problem for an arbitrary input (in our case, arbitrary values of $n$ and $V$).\n","In order to compose a problem formulation, we need to decide on the *solution representation*, i.e., on the predicates and functions that will describe the solution.  The Latin Square Problem seeks a combination of values in matrix $M$.  For the first few exercises, we will use FOL function $\\text{tile}(x, y)$ to represent $M_{y, x}$.

There exist two simple approaches:\n","1. Unlike FOL, Z3 assigns a type to each variable, parameter and function.  We can define a new datatype that has exactly $n$ values, and use it for all our functions and variables.  You already have experience of defining such a datatype (recall the Blocks exercise in Worksheet&nbsp;2).\n","\n","1. We can also use integers for all our variables and functions.  However, if we use integers, the domain of discourse is automatically infinitely large.  Thus, we have to add restrictions to our rules and solution representation.  Specifically, we have to state that the rules only apply when the variable values are between 1 and $n$, and that $1 \\le \\text{tile}(x, y) \\le n$ for all $x$ and $y$.  For example, we can update (1) with\n"," \\begin{multline*}\n"," \\forall x . \\forall y_1 . \\forall y_2 .
